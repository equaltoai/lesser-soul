# ADR 0001: Component Placement (Contracts vs APIs vs Instance Routing)

- Status: Proposed (Milestone M0)
- Date: 2026-02-21

## Context

The term “soul” is used across the EqualtoAI workspace for multiple features. This repository’s `SPEC.md` defines
**lesser-soul as the agent identity/reputation/validation registry layer** (EIP-8004 identity registry + off-chain
registries).

To avoid duplication and drift, we must explicitly define where each responsibility lives, and what is considered
source-of-truth.

## Decision

### 1) Smart contracts (EVM)

**Location:** `lesser-host/contracts/` (sibling repo; same place TipSplitter lives)

- Contracts MUST treat `agentId` as an opaque `uint256` input and MUST NOT implement domain/local string
  normalization.
- Contracts MUST provide the minimum on-chain anchor surface:
  - `getAgentWallet(agentId)` (EIP-8004 compatibility)
  - wallet rotation verification
  - attestation roots for reputation/validation
- Contracts MUST be non-upgradeable; new versions deploy new addresses and consumers are updated via Safe.

### 2) Registry APIs + persistence (control plane)

**Location:** `lesser-host/cmd/control-plane-api` (AppTheory HTTP) + `lesser-host/internal/store/models` (TableTheory)

- The registry API is served through the existing `lesser-host` distribution under `/api/v1/soul/*` per `SPEC.md`.
- APIs MUST implement:
  - `normalizedDomain` normalization
  - `localAgentId` normalization/validation
  - `agentId` derivation
  - signature verification, proof verification, and Safe-ready operation creation
- **All off-chain durable state MUST be stored using TableTheory models** in the existing state table (no raw DynamoDB
  client usage for app state).

### 3) Instance routing (`/soul/*`) and instance-side services

**Location:** `lesser/infra/cdk` (CloudFront behaviors) + `lesser-body` (optional MCP plugin)

- Instance routing (`/soul` and `/soul/*`) is a **path-routing concern** that proxies to an origin discovered via SSM.
- `/soul/*` routing MUST remain stateless and MUST NOT mutate registry state.
- The registry API (`/api/v1/soul/*`) remains hosted in `lesser-host`; instance routing is distinct and must not be
  conflated with registry read/write APIs.

## Consequences

- One canonical implementation of normalization + `agentId` derivation exists in the control plane (and is reused in
  tests/fixtures).
- Contracts stay simple and chain-agnostic; string normalization and proof checks stay off-chain.
- Instance-side `/soul/*` routing can evolve independently (e.g., for `lesser-body`) without changing the registry API
  location or persistence model.
